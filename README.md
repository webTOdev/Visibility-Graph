Progressing Phase : Trying to create Visibility Graph O(n2logn) using Boost lib
                    Using CImg for drawing the VisibilityGraph
                    http://cimg.sourceforge.net/download.shtml
                    Have multiple obstacles and some single point outside the obstacles.
                    All the Obstacles and Lines are calculated using Boost Model package.
                    Geometry calculations have been accomplished using Boost Library
